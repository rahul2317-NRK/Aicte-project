With the increasing need for secure communication and data protection, conventional encryption methods may not always be sufficient to ensure privacy. Cyber threats and unauthorized access to sensitive information pose significant risks in various domains, including defense, healthcare, and finance. Steganography, the practice of concealing data within digital media, offers an additional layer of security by making the existence of the hidden data undetectable. However, implementing an efficient and robust steganographic technique while maintaining the quality of the cover image remains a challenge. This project aims to develop a secure and effective method for embedding and extracting hidden data within images, ensuring minimal perceptual distortion and resilience against detection or modification.
